Description: Correcting and analyzing rapid A/Ci response (RACiR) data. Requires some
    user interaction to adjust the calibration (empty chamber) data file to 
    a useable range. Calibration uses a 1st to 5th order polynomial as 
    suggested in Stinziano et al. (2017) <https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.12911>.
